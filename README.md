PROPOSED machine
This preferred model ambitions to forecast the maximum appropriate crop for specific terrains by way of thinking about various elements and damage prediction. It'll collect statistics from numerous assets, which include government websites..
 
Data preparation (This involves cleansing the statistics, handling missing values, dividing the data into education, and checking out sets)
ML Model FOR YIELD AND RAINFALL PREDICTION(This version will make use of Random Forest Classifier algorithm)
FOR CROP damage (This version will estimate the quantity of crop damage based totally on more than one factor)
EXPERIMENTAL outcomes
We examined the version with diverse information units and the results are almost accurate.
The findings display that the Random wooded area Classifier is successful in forecasting crop damage with a high diploma of precision.
